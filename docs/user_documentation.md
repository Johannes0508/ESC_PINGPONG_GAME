#### 3. FAQs and Troubleshooting

#### Q: The application won't start. What should I do?
- **A**: Ensure all necessary software, such as Python and Pygame, is installed. Verify that all application files are in their correct locations. If you're using an executable file, make sure it has the appropriate permissions to run.

If using an executable, simply double-click the executable file again.
